## Selected Design: Modern Tech Minimalism

I've chosen **Concept 1: Modern Tech Minimalism** for Anil's portfolio. This approach aligns perfectly with his profile as an AI Engineer and Full Stack Developer:

- **Professional yet approachable** - The clean design reflects technical competence without being cold
- **Tech-forward aesthetic** - Cyan accents and geometric elements signal innovation
- **Excellent readability** - Whitespace and typography hierarchy make content accessible
- **Scalable and maintainable** - Minimalist design is easier to update and extend

This design will showcase Anil's projects and skills with clarity and sophistication, making a strong impression on potential employers and collaborators.
